Welcome to Stock Demo.

How to start:
-First "cd" into service and run "mvn spring-boot:run". It will start "Service Application.".
-You can make API calls to "Service Application". Security is disabled; so you do not need to pass any credentials.
-"cd .." to root folder and "cd" into webapp and run "mvn spring-boot:run". It will start "Web Application"
-Goto localhost:8080 and login with "updater1" and "password". You can update price by clicking on price or add new stock.

Assumptions:
-I have not enough time to investigate JWT implementation.
-I ignored auditing.
-There is no repository in the document that I can create a pull request for. So I created mine.
